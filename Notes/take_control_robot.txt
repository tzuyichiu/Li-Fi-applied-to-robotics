// The easiest way is to connect to a screen/keyboard/mouse with the raspberry.

// You can then start the robot, you will have access to a desktop in the same way as on your Linux. You can then connect to the network as on your computer.

// It is necessary to specify the IP of the remote PC, called ROS_MASTER_URI, the IP of the robot itself ROS_HOSTNAME and the model of the robot TURTLEBOT3_MODEL. These three variables must be exported in the ~/.bashrc:

In a terminal:
$ sudo nano ~/.bashrc

Add at the end of the file that opens:

$ export ROS_MASTER_URI = IP_REMOTE_PC
$ export ROS_HOSTNAME = IP_ROBOT
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL = burger

Do the same thing on the Remote PC: only the second line changes and becomes
$ export ROS_HOSTNAME = IP_REMOTE_PC

Once these settings are done you can go to ssh_connection.txt
