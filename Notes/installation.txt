Installation Remote PC.

1. Installation of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

Mandotory to take this version, the version of ROS compatible with TurtleBot is ROS-Kinetic, only compatible with Ubuntu 16.04 (which is not the lastest version of Ubuntu)

- Download the file .iso which corresponds to your PC (available almost every where on internet).
- Create a bootable USB, minimun 4G, with the power iso software.
- Boot on the key, see according to your PC.
- Follow the instructions of the ubuntu install, you can run in Dual Boot but beware ROS is quite large.

2. Installation of ROS Kinetic

- Follow the instructions on this page (better than the instructions of the site ROS itself):
http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/pc_setup/
Commands executed on our PC :
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/robotis_tools/master/install_ros_kinetic.sh && chmod 755 ./install_ros_kinetic.sh && bash ./install_ros_kinetic.sh

Installation of depending packages
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-joy ros-kinetic-teleop-twist-joy ros-kinetic-teleop-twist-keyboard ros-kinetic-laser-proc ros-kinetic-rgbd-launch ros-kinetic-depthimage-to-laserscan ros-kinetic-rosserial-arduino ros-kinetic-rosserial-python ros-kinetic-rosserial-server ros-kinetic-rosserial-client ros-kinetic-rosserial-msgs ros-kinetic-amcl ros-kinetic-map-server ros-kinetic-move-base ros-kinetic-urdf ros-kinetic-xacro ros-kinetic-compressed-image-transport ros-kinetic-rqt-image-view ros-kinetic-gmapping ros-kinetic-navigation ros-kinetic-interactive-markers

$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
$ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs.git
$ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3.git
$ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git
$ cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make

We met a problem as for the installation of caktin package.
The terminal suggests to execute:
$ sudo apt install catkin 

But if it doesn't work, type (to precise the version of ROS): 
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-catkin 

(more information here https://answers.ros.org/question/258444/sudo-apt-install-catkin-not-working/)

You can now connect the robot via ssh: see ssh_connection.txt
